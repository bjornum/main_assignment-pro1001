- Just roughly made the landing page with all its element. It is hardcoded, style instead of classes, and rough looking for now.

# 05.05.2025

- Fixed info title, now are centered, as it should.
- Adjusted info link, with darkslategray colour.
- Counting this section of the landing page as completed, and moving on to the next one.
- Struggling against some default behaviour of css. So moving on for now. The space between header and description was hard. got no time, but noted down.
