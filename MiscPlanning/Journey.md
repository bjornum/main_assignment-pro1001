- Official personal deadline to have the project done. As having the backend one aswell.
- Decided to go with the 80/20 rule, and hopefully have time to finalise it.
- While unhappy with how things are done, ill not down the todos and see if i can wrap the backend exam earlier and come back to this.
- Checkout: Settled for local storage, as it is an simple way to simulate the process using the browser "storage"
- Images: Reducing the images using https://squoosh.app/editor it shows exactly how much quality it loses, how big size of the file is and type one can use!
- Images: Reduced the 5 images from 9.87 mb down to 100kb using type avif and rezise to meet the scaling of the exam requirements (448 / 327)
- Images: Changing everywhere it is done in the application.
